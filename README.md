#### Install
```
 $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daimh/dirfingerprint/master/dirfingerprint
 $ chmod +x dirfingerprint
```
#### Example
* generate a tab delimited file for all directories under /tmp
```
$ dirfingerprint hash /tmp | tee 0.dfp
```
* find new/moved directory
```
$ mkdir /tmp/1 /tmp/2
$ dirfingerprint hash /tmp > 1.dfp
$ dirfingerprint diff 0.dfp 1.dfp
$ mv /tmp/1 /tmp/2
$ dirfingerprint hash /tmp > 2.dfp
$ dirfingerprint diff 1.dfp 2.dfp
```
* print information for all directories that have a depth of 2 or less
```
$ awk '$8 < 2 || NR == 1' 0.dfp
```
* sort all level-3 subdirectories by their size
```
$ awk '$8 == 3' 0.dfp | sort -k 2n
```
* GlusterFS support, access GlusterFS brick nodes and get the metadata directly without network delay

```
$ dirfingerprint hash --gluster-brick=node1:/brick --gluster-brick=node2:/brick .
```

#### Detail

It is always a pain in the eyes to compare two huge directories. Command 'du' doesn't work in all cases because it counts the size of each regular file, directory, soft-link, pipe, block device, etc, For example, if a directory has only empty files, 'du' reports a non-zero size for the directory, and the size varies depending on the underlying filesystem type. Most ordinary users actually don't care about those special files' size.

To rub salt in a wound, how can we find the folders that are renamed or moved to another location?

Further, almost all distributed filesystems don't have a good performance to access their metadata. Repeating some commands such as 'rsync -nav' on them isn't efficient.

Thus, here is 'dirfingerprint', it reports 6 properties for each subdirectories. The properties are calculated on the subdirectory recursively.

FileBytes:	total size of the regular files. This number should be smaller than a 'du -b' as it counts regular files only.

FileCount:	count of the regular files

FileMinMtime:	the oldest mtime of the regular files

FileMaxMtime:	the newest mtime of the regular files

SubdirCount:	count of all subdirectories

SpecialCount:	count of all special files that are not regular file or directory

FingerPrint:	a md5sum based on three parts. The first part is the two numbers of SubdirCount and SpecialCount, the second part is a list of name, size and mtime of the regular files that are one level under the directory, and the third part is a list of name and FingerPrint of all the subdirectories that are one level under the directory.

Dir:	name of the subdirectory

Here is an example of how FingerPrint is calculated, run these commands
```
$ mkdir test
$ touch -t "201901010101" test/f1
$ touch -t "201901010101" test/f2
$ mkdir test/subdir1
$ mkdir test/subdir1/subdir2
$ dirfingerprint hash test
## FingerPrint calculation of the empty directory 'test/subdir1/subdir2'
$ echo "0 0" | md5sum
## FingerPrint calculation of the directory 'test/subdir1'
$ echo -e "1 0\nsubdir2 5928dd99059f0c73963285d86f359fdb" | md5sum
## FingerPrint calculation of the directory 'test'
$ stat -c %Y test/f1 test/f2 #get the mtime
$ echo -e "1 0\nf1 0 1546322460\nf2 0 1546322460\nsubdir1 eecee4276b062aa6c1717dde01094d1d" | md5sum
```

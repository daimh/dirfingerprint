## About
It is always a pain in the eyes to compare two huge directories. Command 'du' doesn't work in all cases because it also counts the metadata size, For example, if a directory has only empty files, 'du' reports a non-zero size for the directory and the size varies depending on the underlying filesystem type. Most ordinary users don't care about size of any non-files. Further, how can we find the directories that were renamed or moved to another location?

In addition, it is not efficient to 'rsync' a huge directory, because rsync is not parallel (yet). We would always want to run multiple rsync processes to speed up huge transfer.

Thus, here is 'dirfingerprint', it reports the following properties for each subdirectory. The properties are calculated on the subdirectory recursively. Then user can use the output files to compare two directories or generate an rsync scripts to synchronize them in parallel.

FingerPrint:	a md5sum based on three parts. The first part is the two numbers of SubdirCount and SpecialCount, the second part is a list of name, size, and mtime of the regular files that are one level under the directory, and the third part is a list of name and FingerPrint of all the subdirectories that are one level under the directory.

FileBytes:	total size of the regular files. This number should be smaller than a 'du -b' as it counts regular files only.

FileCount:	count of the regular files

FileMinMtime:	the oldest mtime of the regular files

FileMaxMtime:	the newest mtime of the regular files

SubdirCount:	count of all subdirectories

SpecialCount:	count of all special files that are not regular file or directory

Depth:	depth of the sub-directory, 0 is the root directory

Dir:	name of the subdirectory

## Install
```
 $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daimh/dirfingerprint/master/dirfingerprint
 $ chmod +x dirfingerprint
 $ ./dirfingerprint -h
```
## Example
* generate a hash for all subdirectories under /tmp
```
(cd /tmp; dirfingerprint hash) > 0.dfp
```
* find new/moved directory
```
mkdir /tmp/1 /tmp/2
(cd /tmp; dirfingerprint hash) > 1.dfp
dirfingerprint diff 0.dfp 1.dfp
mv /tmp/1 /tmp/2
(cd /tmp; dirfingerprint hash) > 2.dfp
dirfingerprint diff 1.dfp 2.dfp
dirfingerprint diff 0.dfp 2.dfp
```
* generate rsync commands to for parallel transfer
```
dirfingerprint rsync 0.dfp 2.dfp user@host:src/ 
dirfingerprint rsync 0.dfp 2.dfp user@host:src/ | parallel -j 8
```
* print information for all directories that have a depth of 2 or less
```
awk '$8 < 2' 0.dfp
```
* sort all level-3 subdirectories by their size
```
awk '$8 == 2' 2.dfp | sort -k 2n
```
* GlusterFS support, access GlusterFS brick nodes and get the metadata directly without the overhead caused by fuse

```
dirfingerprint hash --gluster-brick=node1:/brick --gluster-brick=node2:/brick .
```
